# Primo Log Sampler
This script was developed by Emily Owens at VCU and Mark Baggett at UTK. It is the method of search sampling used for the article "Building Bridges with Logs: Collaborative Conversations about Discovery across Library Departments" (http://journal.code4lib.org/?p=11355) as well as the ELUNA 2016 presentation "Territory Folks Should all be Pals: Qualitative Use of Search Logs to Improve Confidence in and Communication about a Library Discovery Service".

This script will create a HTML report of 100 search queries from a Primo search log file. The report excludes Ex Libris IPs from searches, faceted results pages, browse, course reserve, link resolver searches and only include the first page of search results. After running it will report back the number of logs parsed, the number of queries writen to the file, number of deep links and the number of advanced searches. The script is written in Python and requires the re, random and csv libraries.
